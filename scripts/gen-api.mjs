// Resolve the OpenAPI source for type generation, then run openapi-typescript.
//
// Reads the committed ./openapi.snapshot.json by default, so a clean clone
// builds hermetically — no network, no running API, reproducible.
//
// ⚠ In the monorepo this preferred a LIVE spec at the sibling path
// ../corej-cdisc-rest/target/openapi.json, dumped by the REST module's
// `generate-openapi` profile. That module now lives in a different repository
// (cumba-oss-cdisc-rest, in cumba-oss-clients), so the relative path can never
// resolve again. Left as-is it would not have failed: it would have silently
// taken the fallback forever, and the "types track the running app" property
// would have been quietly untrue.
//
// So the live spec is now an EXPLICIT, NAMED override with no usable default
// (runbook Phase 06d): set COREJ_OPENAPI_SPEC to a spec you dumped yourself.
// A path that is named but missing is a hard error — naming a spec and
// silently getting the snapshot instead is the failure this replaced.
//
// With `--check` (see the `gen:api:check` npm script, which is what the Maven
// build runs at generate-sources) the generated src/api/schema.d.ts must equal
// the version git already has, or the build fails. Without it a regeneration
// is a silent rewrite: the Maven build overwrites the committed file at
// generate-sources and the only trace is an unstaged diff nobody has to
// notice. `npm run gen:api` on its own keeps the plain rewrite behaviour and
// stays the documented way to *fix* a reported drift.
